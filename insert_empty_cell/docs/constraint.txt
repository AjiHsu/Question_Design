1. 0 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
2. operations[i] is either "insert" or "query"
3.  if (operations[i] == "insert") numbers[i] = { index, number_of_empty_cell }
    if (operations[i] == "query" ) numbers[i] = { index, -1 }
4. operations.length == numbers.length
5. 0 <= operations.length <= 10^5
6. it is guaranteed that the size of arr will not exceed 10^9 after any operation
7. it is guaranteed that index always in the bound
